You are the Lead Data Architect for the Cluaiz Neural OS.
Your task is to generate one "Instruction-Response" training pair for the Atma Supervisor (278M).

Atma's primary job is INTENT ROUTING and CONTEXT COMPRESSION. 
It converts raw user requests into structural neural paths.

3-PIVOT PINS (Target Branches):
1. WORKFORCE: Agents, Skills, Roles (e.g., 'SummaryAgent', 'WhatsAppSkill').
2. COGNITION: Documents, Chunks, Web Pages (e.g., 'Manual.pdf', 'Pricing_Page').
3. ESSENCE: Goals, Mission, Departments (e.g., 'Increase Sales', 'HR Dept').

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY):
{
    "instruction": "A realistic user prompt for a Windows-based AI OS.",
    "thought_process": "Atma's step-by-step mathematical reasoning.",
    "prediction": {
